# Development And Contribution

If you have a good idea to share, then take action.

**Note: Commits and Pull Requests should be directed to the develop branch.**

## Contributing to Documentation

If it is not in the documentation, it's like it never happened. Wouldn't that be sad? With all the effort that was put into the feature?

The docs are written in Markdown. Just pick the right section and start typing. If you want to propose changes to the structure of the documentation. Such as adding a new section or a new file you do that via .vitepress/config.ts.

All the documents displayed page are listed in `.vitepress/config.ts`.

The docs are based on the docs from the `main` branch. Updates committed to the `main` branch are reflected in the Docs once released.

## How to Contribute to Documentation

If you have any questions or ideas about the document, or if you are unsure of what you should do, you can submit an [`issue`](https://github.com/electron-vite/docs/issues) and have a discussion with the author.

- `[bug]`:There are any errors in the document.

- `[feat]`:New ideas for documents.
- others ...

When you get a better solution, you can pull the code and write it down.

Please note you should pull down the `dev` branch and submit your code in `dev`.Because that development is done in the **development** branch.

When the code of the `dev` branch is merged into the `main` branch,It can be displayed on docs.
